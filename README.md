# hdfc-api
Hosted api on heroku - https://hdfc-api.herokuapp.com/api/v1/movies

# Project structure and small overview
This is movie ticket booking api, where user can search or view all city, cinemas, or movies accordingly and book the tickets. 
I'm following MVC architectural pattern, that separates an application into three main logical components ie. Module, View and Control. 
This project is JWT, json web token for authorization, bcrypt module for encoding the user password, multiple security/network packages.
Custom error handling as well as 3rd party package usage for handling error, error first callback pattern, middleware, best folder structure and file structure and much more.

# Project Setup

You will get all the folder and files - controllers, modules, db ...etc

# booking movie tickets
-> https://hdfc-api.herokuapp.com/api/v1/movies/book  //use post method

This api can be only used by logged in user. Here the json web token comes into picture. When we login it returns a json web token copy that token and place in header section like : "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_JSON_WEB_TOKEN". Yes, write Bearer then space then paste your jwt and key should be Authorization.
 
 Here we will simply send the required data ie/ name(movie name), price, city, cinema. We are not saving anything here in database because the only goal of this api endpoint is to only verified user can book the tickets or can access this endpoint.
 
data to send - {
  "name" : "example",
  "price" : 304,
  "city" : "delhi",
  "cinema" : "star zen"
}

if user is verified with jwt and required fields are met the response will be :
-> {
  "bookingStatus": "successful",
  "msg": "Ticket of movie example booked in star zen, delhi at price 304"
}
